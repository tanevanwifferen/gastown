Conflict polecat checks `bd show gt-merge-slot`\n2. If status=open:\n   - `bd update gt-merge-slot --status=in_progress --holder=\u003cmr-id\u003e`\n   - Proceed with conflict resolution\n3. If status=in_progress:\n   - Create bead-gate waiting for slot to become open\n   - Block until gate closes\n\n### Priority Ordering\nConvoy graph provides priority:\n- Convoy age (older = higher priority)\n- Epic priority (P0 \u003e P4)\n- Retry count (high retries = penalty)\n\nWitness dispatches conflict resolution in priority order.\nOnly highest-priority waiting work acquires slot when released.\n\n### Releasing the Slot\nAfter merge to main:\n1. `bd update gt-merge-slot --status=open --holder=\"\"`\n2. All waiting gates check slot\n3. Highest-priority waiter acquires\n\n### Direct-to-Main Flow\nConflict polecat with slot:\n1. Rebase on main, resolve conflicts\n2. Run tests\n3. Push directly to main (not back to MR queue)\n4. Close original MR bead\n5. Release merge slot\n\n## Benefits\n- No monkey knife fight (serialized)\n- Priority respected (convoy back-pressure)\n- No queue re-entry (direct to main)\n- Uses existing gates infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n1.

The witness, refinery, and polecat lifecycle components didn't coordinate automatically.\n\n## What Should Have Happened\n\n```\nMayor slings 6 beads to rig\n    ↓\nPolecats auto-spawn with synced beads, work pinned\n    ↓\nPolecats work autonomously\n    ↓\nWitness monitors progress, nudges stuck polecats\n    ↓\nPolecat completes → pushes branch → signals completion\n    ↓\nRefinery detects ready branch → rebases → merges → deletes branch\n    ↓\nWitness detects merge → nukes polecat worktree\n    ↓\nWhen all done → Witness notifies Mayor\n```\n\n## What Actually Happened\n\n1. **gt sling failed to pin beads** - polecat worktrees had stale JSONL\n2. **Manual intervention** - had to checkout latest JSONL, pin, nudge each polecat\n3. **Witness was passive** - never nudged or checked on polecats\n4. **Refinery waited for requests** - didn't detect completed branches\n5. **Manual lifecycle** - Mayor had to close beads, nuke polecats\n6. **Manual merge coordination** - had to mail refinery with merge order\n\n## Root Cause: Branch Hysteresis\n\nPolecat branches persist across runs and drift from main/beads-sync:\n- `polecat/foo` created weeks ago from old main\n- New work slung to `polecat/foo` \n- JSONL in branch doesn't have new beads\n- Pin fails\n\n## Open Questions\n\n### Q1: Fresh branches per run?\nShould each polecat spawn create a NEW branch from latest main/beads-sync?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig\n  → creates polecat/foo-20251227-1630 from origin/main\n  → ensures JSONL is current\n  → after merge, branch deleted forever\n```\nPros: No drift, always current\nCons: Branch proliferation, naming complexity\n\n### Q2: Rebase existing branches?\nOr should we rebase persistent polecat branches before work?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig/foo\n  → git fetch origin\n  → git rebase origin/main\n  → now JSONL is current\n```\nPros: Keeps simple naming\nCons: Rebase can fail with conflicts\n\n### Q3: Just cherry-pick JSONL?\nMinimal fix - grab latest JSONL before pinning:\n```\ngit checkout origin/beads-sync -- .beads/issues.jsonl\nbd import  # refresh DB\nbd pin bd-xxx\n```\nPros: Simple, surgical\nCons: Doesn't fix code drift, just beads\n\n### Q4: Shared beads DB?\nCould polecats share a DB (via symlink or sqlite over network)?\nPros: Always consistent\nCons: Locking complexity, daemon conflicts\n\n### Q5: Who owns polecat lifecycle?\n- Witness? (current assumption)\n- Refinery? (after merge)\n- gt sling? (on spawn)\n- New \"foreman\" role?\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSee child issues for implementation details. Need to resolve open questions first.\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:40:10.727376-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2025-12-28T16:12:13.598411-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T16:12:13.598411-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-ake0m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:15.984785-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-dtw9u","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.036312-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-qpwv4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.08566-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-6qyt1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.134048-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-budeb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.182989-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-5j3ia","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.231484-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

The core issues:\n\n1. **tmux send-keys Enter issue**: `send-keys \"foo\" Enter` concatenates, doesnt send Enter separately\n2. **All sessions look identical**: First message is \"gt prime\" everywhere, `/resume` shows duplicate-looking sessions\n3. **No seance metadata**: Cant differentiate predecessors by sender, role, timestamp, topic\n4. **Hardcoded to Claude**: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` everywhere\n\n## Solution\n\n1. **Unified StartupNudge function** - All paths call one function with rich metadata\n2. **Seance-aware nudge format** - First message contains: sender, recipient, timestamp, topic\n3. **Runtime configuration** - LLM command/args in config, not hardcoded\n4. **gt seance command** - Find and resume predecessor sessions\n\n## Nudge Format\n\nThe startup nudge becomes the session title in `/resume`:\n```\n[GAS TOWN] gastown/crew/gus ← mayor • 2025-12-30T15:42 • cold-start\n```\n\nComponents:\n- Address: gastown/crew/gus (recipient identity)\n- Sender: mayor, deacon, witness, self (for handoff)\n- Timestamp: When session started\n- Topic: mol-id, \"cold-start\", \"handoff\", etc.\n\n## Key Insight\n\nThe GUPP nudge content doesnt matter for triggering propulsion - agent already read CLAUDE.md and hooks ran. What matters is:\n1. The nudge arrives reliably (NudgeSession solves this)\n2. The nudge creates a unique, identifiable session title\n\n## Related\n\n- gt-p2o6s: Extend gt nudge to support channel:name syntax\n- gt-9guv2: Messaging Channels epic\n- Session beacon already exists but is for identity, not session title\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-30T22:47:40.224932-08:00","created_by":"stevey","updated_at":"2025-12-31T11:52:07.539053-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-31T11:52:07.539053-08:00","close_reason":"All success criteria met: (1) All agent startups use unified StartupNudge (gt-7pp3l), (2) Runtime commands from config (gt-j0546), (3) Sessions identifiable in /resume by role, sender, time, topic, (4) gt seance works for predecessor discovery (gt-7qvd7).

{"id":"gt-b93r0","title":"LESSONS: Idle Polecat Incident 2026-01-02","description":"# Incident Summary\n\nOn 2026-01-02, discovered 9 polecats (5 gastown, 4 beads) sitting idle at Claude prompts with completed work, burning money.\n\n## Root Cause Chain\n\n1. **Polecats completed work, submitted MRs** - correct\n2. **Refinery merged work, sent MERGED to Witness** - correct  \n3. **Witness had 50 unread protocol messages** - BUG\n4. **Witness not processing mail = no cleanup** - BUG\n5. **Polecats waiting for death that never comes** - SYMPTOM\n\n## Why Witness Wasn't Patrolling\n\nWitness is a Claude agent with template instructions. When it finishes one patrol cycle, it stops. The template doesn't emphasize continuous operation.\n\nClaude agents are stateless between turns - they complete a task and wait for next input. Without continuous prompting, they idle.\n\n## Design Flaw\n\nThe current model:\n```\nPolecat → gt done → WAIT for Witness to kill\nWitness → process mail → nuke polecat\n```\n\n**Problem**: If Witness doesn't patrol, polecats wait forever.\n\n## Fixes Implemented\n\n1. **gt-lynar**: `gt done --exit` - polecats self-terminate after MR submission\n2. **gt-x4ad3**: Update polecat template to use --exit\n3. **gt-fo9iz**: Nuke safety check - verify work on main, not just 'pushed'\n\n## Lessons\n\n### L1: Agents Should Self-Terminate When Done\nDon't rely on external actors to clean up. If an agent finishes work, it should exit immediately. Waiting = burning money.\n\n### L2: Mail Is Not Reliable Signaling\nClaude agents may not process mail continuously. Don't design protocols that require prompt mail processing.\n\n### L3: Safety Checks Must Match Reality\nAfter branch merge+delete, local branch looks 'unpushed' even though work is on main. Safety checks should verify actual state (is work on main?) not proxy state (is branch pushed?).\n\n### L4: Idle State Is A Bug\nGas Town's propulsion principle: agents are pistons that fire. Idle agents violate this. If an agent can be idle, the design is wrong.\n\n### L5: Monitor What Matters\nWe had convoy status, polecat lists, etc. But no alert for 'polecat at prompt doing nothing'. Add monitoring for actual idle time.\n\n## Future Prevention\n\n1. Polecat template: always use `gt done --exit`\n2. Witness template: emphasize continuous patrol (or replace with daemon)\n3. Add `gt doctor` check: 'polecats at prompt for \u003eN minutes'\n4.

{"id":"gt-e6bx2","title":"Idle polecats are a Gas Town bug - investigate and fix","description":"## Bug: Idle Polecats\n\nPolecats are completing work and sitting idle instead of being cleaned up.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Current State\n- 5 gastown polecats: sessions active, NO hook, finished work, submitted MRs\n- Witness has **50 unread messages** including POLECAT_DONE and MERGED signals  \n- Witness is idle saying \"All 6 polecats idle. System cycling efficiently.\"\n- Polecats at Claude prompt waiting → burning money\n\n### Protocol Flow (Design)\n1. Polecat runs `gt done` → sends POLECAT_DONE to Witness, creates MR bead\n2. Refinery processes MR bead, merges, sends MERGED to Witness  \n3. Witness receives MERGED, verifies clean state, nukes polecat\n\n### What's Broken\n**Witness is not processing its mail inbox.**\n\nThe Witness Claude agent is supposed to patrol: check inbox, process protocol messages, nuke completed polecats. But it's sitting idle at a prompt instead.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Polecats finish work → sit at prompt waiting for death\n- MERGED signals pile up in Witness inbox (unprocessed)\n- Sessions burn money while waiting\n- No cleanup happens\n\n### Design Philosophy Violation\n\nFrom `propulsion-principle.md`:\n\u003e Gas Town is a steam engine. Agents are pistons that MUST fire.\n\nIdle polecats violate this - they're stalled pistons. The design says polecats should be ephemeral: spawn → work → die. No idle state.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Option 1: Self-Terminating Polecats (Recommended)\nAfter `gt done`, polecat should exit Claude session immediately. No waiting for Witness.\n- Add `--exit` flag to `gt done` that runs `/exit` after submitting MR\n- Witness nukes worktree later when processing MERGED (session already gone)\n\n**Pros**: No idle sessions, no burning money\n**Cons**: Minor race condition if nuke runs while session exiting\n\n### Option 2: Witness Polling Daemon  \nReplace Claude-based Witness with a daemon that polls MR queue and nukes polecats.\n- Not dependent on Claude session patrol loops\n- More reliable but loses Claude intelligence\n\n### Option 3: Fix Witness Patrol\nMake Witness actually patrol continuously instead of stopping.\n- Strengthen template to emphasize continuous mail processing\n- Risk: Claude agents still forget/ignore instructions\n\n## Immediate Fix\n\nFor now: Mayor or user must manually nudge Witness or nuke idle polecats.\n\n```bash\n# Check idle polecats\ngt polecat list gastown\n\n# Manual nuke (if verified clean)\ngt polecat nuke gastown/dementus\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n- Witness patrol loop reliability\n- gt done should self-terminate\n- Protocol message handling automation","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-02T13:25:53.995185-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-02T13:57:04.253264-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T13:57:04.253264-08:00","close_reason":"Fix implemented: gt done --exit self-terminates sessions, template updated","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-e6bx2","depends_on_id":"gt-lynar","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-02T13:37:44.897033-08:00","created_by":"mayor"},{"issue_id":"gt-e6bx2","depends_on_id":"gt-x4ad3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-02T13:37:44.945212-08:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}

User has to manually:\n1. `gt witness stop \u003crig\u003e`\n2. `gt witness start \u003crig\u003e`\n\nOr use `gt witness restart \u003crig\u003e` which works but isn't intuitive.\n\n## Proposal\n\n`gt witness start` should have 'ensure running' semantics:\n\n1. If no session exists → create new session\n2. If session exists and healthy → do nothing (already running)\n3. If session exists but zombie → kill and recreate\n\nThis makes `start` idempotent and safe to run repeatedly.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```go\nfunc (w *Witness) Start(rig string) error {\n    sessionName := witnessSessionName(rig)\n    \n    if w.tmux.HasSession(sessionName) {\n        if w.isHealthy(sessionName) {\n            return nil  // Already running and healthy\n        }\n        // Zombie - kill it\n        w.tmux.KillSession(sessionName)\n    }\n    \n    // Create fresh session\n    return w.createSession(rig)\n}\n```\n\n## Alternatives\n\n- Keep current behavior, just improve error message: 'Session exists but appears dead, use restart'\n- Add --force flag: `gt witness start --force \u003crig\u003e`\n\n## Recommendation\n\nMake `start` idempotent.

{"id":"gt-f7jxr","title":"Cost tracking v2: Use beads instead of JSONL","description":"## Overview\n\nRevise cost tracking to use beads as the storage layer instead of `~/.gt/costs.jsonl`. This aligns with Gas Town's \"Discover, Don't Track\" principle and keeps beads as the single source of truth.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **bd-vii9**: Agent identity beads (service polecats) - provides the parent beads for sessions\n\n## Model\n\n### Agent Identity Bead (type: agent)\n\nCreated on first use of a polecat/agent name. Persists across session lifecycles.\n\n```yaml\nid: gt-gastown-polecat-toast\ntype: agent\ntitle: \"Agent: gt-gastown-polecat-toast\"\nstatus: open  # Always open (persistent identity)\nmetadata:\n  role: polecat\n  rig: gastown\n  name: toast\nlabels:\n  total_cost: \"4.56\"       # Cache for fast queries\n  session_count: \"12\"\n  last_active: \"2026-01-02\"\n```\n\n### Session Event Bead (type: session)\n\nCreated when a session ends (via Stop hook).\n\n```yaml\nid: gt-sess-abc123\ntype: session\ntitle: \"Session: toast completed gt-nrpiq\"\nparent: gt-gastown-polecat-toast   # Links to agent\nstatus: closed\nmetadata:\n  cost_usd: 1.23\n  duration_seconds: 1800\n  work_item: gt-nrpiq\n  started_at: \"2026-01-02T12:00:00Z\"\n  ended_at: \"2026-01-02T12:30:00Z\"\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Update `gt costs record`\n\nInstead of appending to JSONL:\n```go\n// Create session bead\nbd create --type session --parent $AGENT_BEAD \\\n  --title \"Session: $NAME completed $WORK_ITEM\" \\\n  --metadata cost_usd=1.23,duration_seconds=1800,...\n\n// Update agent bead labels (cache)\nbd label $AGENT_BEAD total_cost=$NEW_TOTAL session_count=$NEW_COUNT\n```\n\n### 2. Update `gt costs` queries\n\nReplace JSONL parsing with bd queries:\n```bash\n# Today's sessions\nbd list --type=session --since=today\n\n# Sessions for agent\nbd list --type=session --parent=gt-gastown-polecat-toast\n\n# All agents with costs\nbd list --type=agent\n```\n\n### 3. Remove JSONL support\n\n- Remove `~/.gt/costs.jsonl` writes\n- Remove JSONL parsing code\n- Migration: optionally import existing JSONL into beads\n\n## Queries Supported\n\n| Command | Implementation |\n|---------|---------------|\n| `gt costs` | Live tmux scrape (unchanged) |\n| `gt costs --today` | `bd list --type=session --since=today` + sum |\n| `gt costs --week` | `bd list --type=session --since=week` + sum |\n| `gt costs --by-role` | `bd list --type=agent` + group by role label |\n| `gt costs --by-rig` | `bd list --type=agent` + group by rig label |\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Single source of truth (beads)\n- Git-backed audit trail\n- Queryable via `bd list`\n- Syncs with `bd sync`\n- Follows \"Events as State History, Labels as Cache\" pattern\n\n## Non-goals\n\n- Per-message cost tracking (too granular)\n- Real-time cost streaming (agent limitation)\n\n## References\n\n- GH #24 (original cost tracking issue)\n- bd-vii9 (agent identity beads)\n- docs/agent-compatibility.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"gastown/polecats/capable","created_at":"2026-01-02T13:08:02.25522-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-02T13:24:18.875146-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T13:24:18.875146-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented cost tracking v2 using beads events"}

{"id":"gt-htlmp.1","title":"Design: CI test infrastructure and approach","description":"Design decisions for CI test infrastructure.\n\n## Decisions Made\n\n### 1. Test Framework\n**Decision**: Go's standard testing with `//go:build integration` tag\n\nRationale:\n- Familiar to Go developers\n- Easy to run separately: `go test -tags=integration ./...`\n- Can have different timeouts for unit vs integration\n- No external test framework dependencies\n\n### 2. Temp Directory Strategy  \n**Decision**: `t.TempDir()` per test\n\nRationale:\n- Auto-cleanup (no manual defer needed)\n- Test isolation - each test gets fresh state\n- Easy debugging - can add `t.Setenv(\"KEEP_TEMP\", \"1\")` to preserve\n\n### 3. Git Repo Handling\n**Decision**: Create minimal repos on-the-fly with `git init`\n\nRationale:\n- Faster than cloning fixtures\n- No external dependencies\n- Tests exactly what users do\n- Helper: `createTestGitRepo(t, name)`\n\n### 4. bd Daemon\n**Decision**: Run bd commands directly without daemon\n\nRationale:\n- bd CLI works fine for basic operations\n- Simpler test setup\n- Daemon adds complexity without testing benefit for install flow\n\n### 5. CI Integration\n**Decision**: Separate job with path filtering\n\n- Runs on: push to main, PRs touching install/rig/config/routing code\n- Timeout: 5 minutes (vs 2 min for unit tests)\n- Installs bd from beads repo before running\n\n## Implementation\n- Created: `internal/cmd/install_integration_test.go`\n- Updated: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with integration job\n\n## Test Cases Implemented\n- TestInstallCreatesCorrectStructure\n- TestInstallBeadsHasCorrectPrefix  \n- TestInstallIdempotent\n- Helper: createTestGitRepo","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-02T13:01:04.586688-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-02T13:12:32.780925-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T13:12:32.780925-08:00","close_reason":"Design complete with implementation skeleton","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-htlmp.1","depends_on_id":"gt-htlmp","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-02T13:01:04.59025-08:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}

Currently, session costs are never actually recorded to beads because nothing calls this command.\n\n## Implementation\n\nAdd to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or project settings):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"Stop\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"gt costs record --session \\$GT_SESSION\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, add to the session-end hook script if we use that pattern.\n\n## Considerations\n\n1. **Session name**: Need to pass the tmux session name.

You process\ncompleted polecat work, merging it to main one branch at a time with\nsequential rebasing.\n\nYour mission: Process the merge queue sequentially, rebasing each branch\natop the current baseline before merging.\n\nsession_pattern: gt-{rig}-refinery\nwork_dir_pattern: {town}/{rig}/refinery/rig\nneeds_pre_sync: true\nstart_command: exec claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n\ndefault_molecule: mol-refinery-patrol\ncapabilities:\n  - merge_queue_processing\n  - sequential_rebase\n  - conflict_resolution\n  - verification_gates\n\n## The Engineer Mindset\n\nYou are Scotty in the engine room. The merge queue is your warp core.\n\nThe Beads Promise: Work is never lost. If you discover ANY problem:\n1. Fix it now (preferred if quick), OR\n2. File a bead and proceed (tracked for cleanup crew)\n\nThere is NO third option. Never \"disavow\" by noting something exists and moving on.\n\nThe Scotty Test: Before proceeding past any failure, ask yourself:\n\"Would Scotty walk past a warp core leak because it existed before his shift?\"\n\n## Propulsion Principle\n\nIf you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\n\nYour work is defined by the mol-refinery-patrol molecule.

Next branch MUST rebase on new baseline.\n\n## Verification Gate\n\nThe handle-failures step is a verification gate:\n- Tests PASSED: Gate satisfied, proceed to merge\n- Tests FAILED (branch caused): Abort, notify polecat, skip branch\n- Tests FAILED (pre-existing): MUST fix OR file bead - cannot proceed without\n\n## Commands\n\n### Patrol\n- gt mol status - Check attached patrol\n- bd ready / bd show / bd close - Step management\n- bd mol spawn \u003cmol\u003e --wisp - Spawn patrol wisp\n\n### Git Operations\n- git fetch origin - Fetch all remote branches\n- git branch -r | grep polecat - List polecat branches\n- git rebase origin/main - Rebase on current main\n- git push origin main - Push merged changes\n\n### Communication\n- gt mail inbox - Check for messages\n- gt mail send \u003caddr\u003e -s \"Subject\" -m \"Message\" - Notify workers","status":"hooked","priority":2,"issue_type":"role","assignee":"gastown/polecats/rictus","created_at":"2025-12-28T00:51:21.133839-08:00","created_by":"stevey","updated_at":"2025-12-30T02:03:13.028107-08:00","labels":["migrated-to:hq-refinery-role"]}

{"id":"gt-t6muy","title":"Design: Polecat lifecycle and patrol coordination","description":"## Context\n\nThis design captures thinking from a deep session about the Gas Town propulsion system - how Deacon, Witness, Refinery, and Polecats coordinate to move work smoothly through the system.\n\n## Core Insight: Session-Per-Step Model\n\nPolecats do NOT complete complex molecules end-to-end. Instead:\n- One polecat SESSION per molecule STEP\n- Same sandbox (branch/worktree) persists across sessions\n- Each step: spawn → work → close bead → recycle session\n- Final step: spawn → work → close bead → signal complete → merge → nuke sandbox\n\n## Two Cleanup Stages\n\n| Stage | Trigger | Kills | Survives |\n|-------|---------|-------|----------|\n| Step cleanup | Step bead closed | Session | Branch, worktree, molecule |\n| Molecule cleanup | Merged | Session, branch, worktree | Digest |\n\n## Per-Rig Polecat Channel\n\nNeed a mailing list/queue per rig for session-lifecycle requests:\n- \"Recycle me\" (from polecat)\n- \"Recycle worker X\" (from witness/mayor)\n- \"Spawn for step Y\" (from anyone)\n\nFirst-come-first-served by patrolling agents. Anyone on patrol (Witness, Refinery, Crew, Mayor) can service requests.\n\n## GUPP + Pinned Work = Completion\n\nAs long as:\n1. Work is pinned to polecat identity (e.g., gastown/furiosa)\n2. Sandbox persists (branch + worktree)\n3. Someone keeps spawning polecat when it dies\n\n→ The molecule WILL get finished. GUPP ensures wake-and-work.\n\n## Daemon → Deacon Heartbeat\n\nThe daemon pings the deacon, keeping the cycle alive. Deacon peeks into rig-wide channels during patrol and can service lifecycle requests.\n\n## Open Design Questions\n\n### Q1: Spoon-Feeding Bin-Packing\nTwo dimensions of granularity trade-offs:\n- How many logical steps per physical molecule step?\n- How many molecule steps per polecat session?\n\nToo few steps → context exhaustion, forgetting\nToo many steps → overhead, fragmentation\n\nNeeds: Analysis of optimal granularity based on step complexity.\n\n### Q2: Mechanical vs Agent-Driven Recycling\nCaution from deacon murder spree bug: mechanical detection of \"stuck\" workers is fragile.\n\nPrefer: Explicit \"recycle me\" requests serviced by patrol agents.\n\nQuestion: When is mechanical intervention appropriate?\n\n### Q3: Channel Implementation\nOptions:\n- Mail-based (gt mail to rig/polecats)\n- Beads-based (special issue type)\n- State file (rig/polecat-queue.json)\n\nMail seems most consistent with Gas Town patterns.\n\n### Q4: Who Spawns Next Step?\nCurrent: gt sling spawns fresh polecat\nNeeded: Mechanism for \"continue molecule on existing sandbox\"\n\nMaybe: gt sling --continue or witness detects pending step.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-dtw9u: Witness monitoring (enhance survey-workers)\n- gt-qpwv4: Completion detection (check ready branches)\n- gt-6qyt1: Refinery queue (process MERGE_READY)\n- gt-budeb: Auto-nuke (handle MERGED signal)\n- gt-5j3ia: Swarm aggregation (batch completion)\n- gt-1dbcp: Polecat auto-start (SessionStart hook issue)\n\n## Design Principles (from HOP/MEOW context)\n\n1. **Discovery over tracking** - observe reality each cycle\n2. **Mail as coordination primitive** - agents signal via mail\n3. **ZFC** - Claude makes judgment calls, no hardcoded thresholds\n4. **Redundant monitoring** - overlapping observation is resilience\n5. **Wisps are ephemeral** - patrol molecules flow like water\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Finalize channel design (mail-based queue)\n2. Enhance witness patrol formula with completion detection\n3. Enhance refinery patrol with MERGED signaling\n4. Implement step-level recycling\n5.

Schedule independent MRs first, then handle remaining sequentially\n\n## Implementation\n- Add file analysis to MR submission (gt done)\n- Store changed_files in MR wisp\n- Refinery sorts queue by: priority → conflicts → age\n\n## Example\n```\nQueue: [A, B, C, D]\nFiles:\n  A: auth/login.go\n  B: payments/checkout.go  \n  C: auth/login.go ← conflicts with A!\n  D: docs/readme.md\n\nOptimal: [A, B, D, C] - A, B, D can merge without waiting\n```\n\n## Parent\ngt-lxxh2","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-25T18:30:19.240371-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T18:30:19.240371-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-tst6j","depends_on_id":"gt-lxxh2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T18:30:33.226294-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"gt-ubqeg","title":"Formula Molecules: Guzzoline production for Gas Town","description":"## Vision\n\nGas Town executes work. But it also needs to PRODUCE work - structured, high-quality guzzoline on demand. **Formula Molecules** are recipes that spawn structured convoys.\n\n## Core Insight\n\nA formula is a molecule template that:\n1. Takes input (a PR, a design problem, a codebase)\n2. Spawns multiple polecats with specific focuses\n3. Each leg produces structured output\n4. Synthesis step combines into unified deliverable\n\nGas Town becomes both consumer AND producer of guzzoline.\n\n## Example Formulas\n\n### Design Convoy Formula\nInput: Feature request or problem statement\nLegs (parallel):\n- API design polecat\n- Data model polecat  \n- UX/ergonomics polecat\n- Scalability polecat\n- Security polecat\nSynthesis: Unified design doc with tradeoffs\n\n### Code Review Convoy Formula\nInput: PR or file set\nLegs (parallel):\n- Correctness: Does it work?\n- Performance: Any bottlenecks?\n- Security: Vulnerabilities?\n- Elegance: Clean design?\n- Resilience: Error handling?\n- Style: Convention compliance?\n- Smells: Anti-patterns?\n- Legacy: Respects existing patterns?\nSynthesis: Categorized review with priority issues\n\n### Other Formula Ideas\n- Test Coverage Convoy: Unit, integration, edge cases, error paths\n- Documentation Convoy: API docs, user guide, examples, changelog\n- Migration Convoy: Database, API, config, rollback plan\n- Incident Response: Root cause, timeline, fix, prevention\n\n## Mol Mall\n\nLibrary/marketplace of formulas:\n```bash\ngt formula list              # Available formulas\ngt formula show code-review  # Formula details\ngt formula run code-review --pr=123  # Execute formula → convoy\ngt formula create my-review  # Create custom formula\n```\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Formula Structure (in beads)\n```yaml\nid: formula-code-review\ntype: formula\nname: Code Review\ninputs:\n  - name: target\n    type: pr | files | branch\nlegs:\n  - name: correctness\n    focus: \"Verify logical correctness and edge cases\"\n    output: findings.md\n  - name: security\n    focus: \"Identify security vulnerabilities\"\n    output: findings.md\n  # ...\nsynthesis:\n  inputs: all leg outputs\n  output: review-summary.md\n```\n\n### Execution Model\n1. `gt formula run` creates convoy with formula reference\n2. Spawns polecats for each leg (parallel where possible)\n3. Each polecat gets leg-specific prompt + shared context\n4. Outputs collected as bead attachments or slots\n5. Synthesis polecat reads all outputs, produces final deliverable\n6. Convoy lands with unified result\n\n### Dependencies\n- Leg outputs feed synthesis (internal convoy deps)\n- Formula can specify leg ordering if needed\n- Parallel by default, sequential where required\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Where do formulas live? Town-level beads? Separate formula registry?\n2. How to version/share formulas across towns?\n3. Leg output format standardization?\n4. Human checkpoints between legs or only at end?\n5. Partial formula runs (skip some legs)?\n6. Formula composition (formula that includes other formulas)?\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGas Town currently waits for humans to create work. With formulas:\n- Mayor can invoke structured reviews on any PR\n- Design work follows consistent methodology\n- Quality processes are repeatable and scalable\n- Work generation becomes as automated as work execution\n\n**Guzzoline factory, not just guzzoline consumer.**","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-31T13:19:45.702191-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2025-12-31T13:19:45.702191-08:00"}

Stale worktrees far behind main\n- Example: max is 67 commits behind origin/main\n- Worktrees created, used, abandoned without cleanup\n- No lifecycle process resets or cleans them\n\n### 3. `.claude/` not gitignored\n- Claude Code creates `.claude/commands/` in polecats\n- Accumulates as untracked files ('1 uncommitted change' cases)\n\n### 4.

It is about waiting for signals with a timeout.**\n\nThis epic captures the shift from time-driven to event-driven patrol wake.\n\n## Key Insight (Recovered from 2025-12-29 session crash)\n\nThe Beads activity feed (bd activity --follow) is the universal data plane for\nwake signals. Every meaningful action creates a beads mutation; agents subscribe to\nthe feed and wake within ~500ms. The timeout is just a safety net.\n\n**OLD**: Time-driven. Wake because time passed. Poll less when idle.\n**NEW**: Event-driven. Wake because signal arrived. Timeout is safety net.\n\n## Architecture\n\nANY MUTATION:\n  bd create/update/close -\u003e issues.jsonl mutation\n                        -\u003e bd activity --follow sees it (~500ms)\n                        -\u003e All subscribed agents wake immediately\n\nPATROL AGENT:\n  Runs bd activity --follow as background source\n  Any output line = wake signal\n  Timeout expiry = safety net (not primary wake)\n\n## Wake Sources (Priority Order)\n\n| Source | Latency | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| Feed | ~500ms | Primary - any beads mutation |\n| Nudge | Instant | Explicit wake (startup hooks) |\n| Timeout | Backoff | Safety net for missed signals |\n| Daemon | 5-60min | GUPP backstop, session recovery |\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. No wake_on conditions - signals carry no semantic meaning. Just wake up.\n   Agent discovers reality by checking mail, beads, hook, git state.\n\n2. Read-only commands do not wake - gt status, bd show create no mutations.\n\n3. Daemon is recovery-focused - catches edge cases (GUPP violations, dead sessions).\n\n4.

{"id":"gt-x5gxi","title":"Daemon/Boot/Deacon Watchdog Chain: Fix session lifecycle management","description":"## Summary\n\nThe watchdog chain (Daemon → Boot → Deacon → Witness/Refinery) has multiple bugs preventing auto-recovery of dead agents:\n\n1. Boot spawns in wrong session\n2. Daemon can't kill zombie sessions\n3. Binary/process age mismatch goes undetected\n4. Status display doesn't reconcile bead vs tmux state\n5. Start commands don't have 'ensure' semantics\n\n## Impact\n\nWhen witness/refinery die, they stay dead until manual intervention. The entire purpose of the Deacon (health monitoring) is defeated.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nSession lifecycle management lacks 'ensure running' semantics. The code assumes:\n- If session doesn't exist → create it\n- If session exists → it's healthy\n\nReality:\n- Sessions can be zombies (tmux alive, Claude dead)\n- Bead state and tmux state can diverge\n- Daemon process can run old code\n\n## Child Issues\n\n- gt-sgzsb: Boot session confusion (P1)\n- gt-j1i0r: Zombie session blocking (P1)\n- gt-d48f2: Binary age detection (P2)\n- gt-doih4: Status bead/tmux mismatch (P2)\n- gt-ekc5u: Start 'ensure' semantics (P2)\n- gt-1847v: Boot/Deacon documentation (P2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1.

This is wrong - formulas are reference documents describing a workflow, not templates to be instantiated into trackable work.\n\n## What Happened\n\n1. Formula exists at `.beads/formulas/mol-deacon-patrol.formula.toml`\n2. Deacon (or predecessor agent) created an epic + 9 task beads matching the formula steps\n3. These showed up in `bd ready` (separate bug filed)\n\n## Correct Model\n\n| Artifact | Purpose | Created How |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| Formula (.toml) | Reference doc describing workflow | Manual/design |\n| Wisp | Ephemeral execution context | `bd wisp create` (no child beads) |\n| Proto | Template for pour | `bd cook` from formula |\n\n**Formulas should NOT create beads.** They're documentation. When the Deacon runs a patrol, it follows the formula instructions directly - it doesn't need beads for each step.\n\n## Fix Needed\n\n1. Update Deacon template to clarify: \"Follow the formula instructions. Do not create beads from formula steps.\"\n2. Audit what command created the beads - was it `bd wisp create` expanding the formula? If so, that command shouldn't create child beads.\n3.

{"id":"gt-3qw5s","title":"ZFC: Auto-close convoys when tracked issues close via bd close","description":"When bd close closes an issue, check if this issue was tracked by any convoy. If all tracked issues in a convoy are now closed, auto-close the convoy.\n\n## Background\nPR #236 attempted to fix stale convoys by calling gt convoy check in the refinery merge handler. This is a ZFC violation - it couples the refinery to convoy semantics and uses the wrong trigger point.\n\n## Proper ZFC approach\nThe closure event should propagate at the source:\n1. bd close closes an issue\n2. Check if this issue is tracked by any open convoy\n3. For each convoy tracking this issue, check if all tracked issues are now closed\n4. If so, auto-close the convoy\n\n## Implementation notes\n- Add convoy-check logic to bd close command\n- The deacon patrol step check-convoy-completion remains as backup\n\n## Related\n- PR #236 (closed - ZFC violation)\n- Deacon patrol step: check-convoy-completion","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T02:53:47.000000Z","created_by":"gastown/crew/joe","updated_at":"2026-01-07T02:53:47.000000Z"}
